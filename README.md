BIM216 Project. AMS aims to enable companies to easily track, analyze, manage, add, remove assets, and swiftly identify potential issues for quick action. 
The project we have developed establishes a shared platform for Asset Managers, IT Managers, Finance, and Risk Managers within the company. 
Through the account system, various authorized Managers in different areas can easily fulfill their responsibilities. 
Users can search for assets using filters among assets and easily access the asset they are looking for. Assets under specific categories can be analyzed among themselves, and possible issues and risks regarding assets can also be examined. 
Functionally, assets can be added, updated, and deleted. Additionally, categorization and classification can be performed. Thus, the goal is to create a system for companies to easily manage their assets.
